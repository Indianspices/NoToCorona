<h1>NoToCorona</h1><hr>
This time of uncertainty has impacted the lives of millions and I was one of them.
Being in quarantine desperately, I was looking for some solutions that can stop the spread of coronavirus and came to the idea of Building NoToCorona project.<br>
NoToCorona project uses deep learning and computer vision to detect 
Humans, Check the mask on his face, Check the body temperature, and notifies to the operator with an alarm.

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
NoToCorona takes input from the webcam and breaks the video into frames.
After breaking into frames, it uses OpenCV to detect wheater the input coming is of a human face or not.
As it matches that its Human face, It uses deep learning trained model to detect whether the person has heard a mask or not. 

After identifying the things it opens a new tab where the output is visible with a label, "With Mask" or "Without Mask".
